## Testimonials

1. Krauck-Systems: Alfred Krauck - CEO of Krauck-Systems :Alexander quickly made it possible for me to ask even difficult questions about each project that we have done so far.
2. JKU - ML Institute: Sepp Hochreiter - Professor at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz: Alexander's main project during his internship was the exploration of existing and new Graph Neural Network architectures. Together with another researcher from our institute, he succeeded in inventing a new type of graph neural network that easily outperforms similar experimental methods. This achievement testifies to his creative approach and his ambition to develop new approaches in the field of machine learning and AI and also to implement them efficiently by means of programming.
3. JKU - Computational Perception Institute: Markus Schedl - Professor at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz: His achievements in this work specifically at the ACM RecSys Challenge 2021 were very impressive and demonstrate his technical skills and independence.
