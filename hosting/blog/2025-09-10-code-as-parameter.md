**A practical guide to treating code like adjustable settings for different language models—when to upgrade, when to freeze, and how to benchmark before you ship.**

---

## TL;DR 
With AI agents, newer code isn't automatically better. Treat code like adjustable knobs that must fit the model you're using. Freeze the stable core, keep model-specific parts flexible, benchmark before you merge, and consider two repositories: one for stable product code, another for the LLM orchestration layer.

## The Red Thread: What This Article Is Really About

Picture this: Your team just spent a week perfecting prompts for GPT-4. Everything works beautifully. Then you switch to Claude or an open-source model to save costs, and suddenly your carefully crafted system falls apart. Sound familiar?

Most software teams live by a simple rule: **latest version wins**. But when your application relies on large language models (LLMs), that habit becomes a liability. A code change that makes one model sing can make another stumble.

The fix isn't complicated—it's a mindset shift. **Code becomes configuration**. We tune it to the model like adjusting an equalizer for different speakers. We don't worship the newest version; we worship what works.

This article hands you a battle-tested approach: separate what should be rock-solid from what should be model-aware, test changes against real tasks you care about, and ship the best variant for today's model. No PhD required—just practical patterns that work.

## Why "Newer" Can Be Worse (And How to Spot It)

### The Guardrail Paradox

**Old Models:** Remember GPT-3.5? It needed training wheels everywhere—explicit step-by-step instructions, aggressive error handling, multiple validation layers. Like teaching a teenager to drive.

**New Models:** Modern agent-ready models like GPT-4 or Claude 3 already learned these patterns. Those same guardrails now act like keeping the parking brake on while driving—they slow everything down and prevent elegant solutions.

**Real Example:** A customer support bot that forced responses into a rigid template saw 40% better responses when those constraints were removed for newer models, but complete chaos when removed for older ones.

### Same Change, Different Outcome

Think of models like chefs with different styles. Give a French chef and a sushi master the same ingredients—you'll get completely different dishes. Similarly:

- A prompt asking for "detailed analysis" makes Model A verbose but Model B concise
- Adding chain-of-thought reasoning helps Model X but confuses Model Y
- Tool-calling syntax that works for one model breaks another

**Signal to Watch:** After implementing that "brilliant" optimization, check:
- Task success rates drop on certain models
- Response latency spikes unexpectedly  
- Users complain about quality changes after a model switch

Don't panic-revert. Route to what works best per model.

## Think in Layers: Freeze the Core, Flex the Orchestrator

Your codebase isn't monolithic—it's a wedding cake with different layers that change at different speeds.

### Layer 1: Stable Core (Freeze It) 🔒

**What belongs here:**
- Safety checks (profanity filters, PII detection)
- Data contracts (API schemas, database models)
- Domain logic (business rules, calculations)
- Logging and telemetry infrastructure

**Characteristics:**
- Changes maybe once a quarter
- Breaking it breaks everything
- Model-agnostic—works regardless of AI choice

**Management Rules:**
- Protected branches with mandatory reviews
- Comprehensive contract tests
- Treat changes like heart surgery—carefully and rarely

### Layer 2: Orchestration Layer (Keep It Flexible) 🔄

**What belongs here:**
- System and user prompts
- Planning depth and strategies
- Tool selection and routing logic
- Retry policies and timeout configurations
- Error recovery approaches

**Characteristics:**
- Changes with every model swap or upgrade
- Safe to experiment without breaking core functionality
- Highly model-specific optimizations

**Management Rules:**
- Easy branching and experimentation
- Benchmark-driven development
- Runtime selection based on model profiles

## The Two-Repo Strategy: Keep Your Product Safe and Your Agent Fast

Here's the game-changer: **split your codebase physically**, not just conceptually.

### Repository A: Stable Product Core 🏛️

```
stable-product-core/
├── core/
│   ├── domain/           # Business logic
│   ├── safety/           # Security & compliance
│   └── infrastructure/   # Database, queues, etc.
├── contracts/
│   ├── api/             # OpenAPI specs
│   └── data/            # Schema definitions
└── tests/
    └── contract/        # Non-negotiable tests
```

**Ownership:** Product/Platform team  
**Deploy Frequency:** Weekly to monthly  
**CI Rule:** Changes here trigger full regression suite

### Repository B: LLM Orchestration 🚀

```
llm-orchestration/
├── adapters/
│   ├── gpt4_turbo/      # GPT-4 specific logic
│   ├── claude3/         # Claude specific logic
│   └── llama3/          # Llama specific logic
├── prompts/
│   ├── templates/       # Reusable prompt parts
│   └── chains/          # Multi-step workflows
├── tools/
│   ├── definitions/     # Tool schemas
│   └── policies/        # When to use what
├── experiments/
│   └── sandbox/         # Try wild ideas here
└── benchmarks/
    ├── tasks/           # What success looks like
    └── results/         # Historical performance
```

**Ownership:** AI/ML team  
**Deploy Frequency:** Daily if needed  
**CI Rule:** Must pass compatibility tests with Repo A

### Why Split Repositories?

**Clear Ownership:** No more "who owns the prompt code?" debates  
**Independent Velocity:** Ship AI improvements without risking core stability  
**Clean Rollbacks:** Revert orchestration changes without touching the product  
**Better Testing:** Each repo has focused, relevant test suites

## Benchmark Before You Merge: Small, Focused, Automatic

You don't need a PhD or fancy tools—just consistency and automation.

### Level 1: End-to-End Task Success 🎯

Define 5-10 tasks that represent real user value:

```python
benchmark_tasks = [
    "Summarize this 10-page report in 3 bullets",
    "Convert this angry email to professional tone",
    "Extract action items from meeting transcript",
    "Generate API documentation from code",
    "Answer product question using knowledge base"
]

for task in benchmark_tasks:
    for model in ["gpt-4", "claude-3", "llama-3"]:
        result = run_task(task, model)
        record_metric(success_rate, latency, cost)
```

### Level 2: Module Health Checks 🔧

Validate specific capabilities:
- **Prompt Formatting:** Does the prompt render correctly?
- **Tool Calling:** Are tools invoked with proper syntax?
- **Error Handling:** Do failures recover gracefully?
- **Response Quality:** Does output match expected format?

### Level 3: Model Personality Profiles 👥

Create profiles that capture model characteristics:

```yaml
profiles:
  conservative:
    models: ["gpt-3.5-turbo", "older-llama"]
    traits: "Needs explicit instructions, benefits from examples"
    optimizations: "Heavy guardrails, step-by-step guidance"
    
  balanced:
    models: ["gpt-4", "claude-2"]
    traits: "Good reasoning, occasional creativity"
    optimizations: "Moderate structure, some flexibility"
    
  agent_ready:
    models: ["gpt-4-turbo", "claude-3-opus"]
    traits: "Strong autonomy, handles ambiguity"
    optimizations: "Minimal constraints, trust the model"
```

### The Decision Matrix

After benchmarking every change:

| Result | Action | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Green** ✅ | All profiles improve | Merge immediately |
| **Yellow** ⚠️ | Mixed results | Ship as variant, route by model |
| **Red** ❌ | Broad regression | Archive (don't delete—might work later) |

## Shipping Model-Aware Variants Without Chaos

### Runtime Selection Pattern

```python
def get_orchestrator(model_name: str, task_type: str = None):
    """Select the best orchestrator for this model/task combo"""
    
    # Default mapping
    orchestrator_map = {
        "gpt-4-turbo": "agent_ready",
        "gpt-3.5": "conservative",
        "claude-3": "balanced"
    }
    
    # Task-specific overrides
    if task_type == "legal_document":
        return "conservative"  # Always play it safe
    
    return orchestrator_map.get(model_name, "balanced")
```

### Configuration-Driven Approach

```yaml
# config.yml
models:
  production:
    name: "gpt-4-turbo"
    adapter: "agent_ready"
    fallback: "balanced"
    
  cost_optimized:
    name: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    adapter: "conservative"
    
experiments:
  new_model_test:
    name: "anthropic-claude-3"
    adapter: "experimental_v2"
    traffic_percentage: 5
```

## Migration Playbook: Switching Models Without Drama

### Week 1: Preparation
1. **Freeze Repo A** - No core changes during migration
2. **Clone closest adapter** in Repo B
3. **Run baseline benchmarks** with current model

### Week 2: Adaptation
1. **Tune the new adapter** - Adjust prompts, retries, timeouts
2. **Run comparative benchmarks** - Old vs new
3. **Document quirks** - "This model hates JSON in prompts"

### Week 3: Gradual Rollout
1. **5% traffic** to new model (power users only)
2. **Monitor metrics** obsessively
3. **Gather user feedback** through support tickets

### Week 4: Decision Time
- **Victory:** New model wins → Increase traffic gradually
- **Mixed:** Some tasks better, some worse → Route by task type
- **Defeat:** Worse overall → Archive and try again later
